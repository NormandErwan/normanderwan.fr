I participated in my first game jam with the [Ludum Dare 44](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44). I enjoyed the
process and I'm quite proudly surprised of our result!

You can [play it online](https://solroo.itch.io/bloedbad) and [view the submission](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/bloedbad).

Now I have a job, I can look back over my study years. I remember I was playing a lot to video games when I was young
while dreaming of working at Ubisoft Montréal. But I haven't created any game yet. Some members of
[team at Inria](https://team.inria.fr/potioc) really like making games during these kind of events. So when they
proposed me to try the next game jam with them, I was in!

This game jam's theme was "Your life is a currency". We did a retro metroidvania where you're a demon that can/must pay
with its health for better weapons or to open doors. But as you're bleeding, time is running against you. You can kill
enemies or sacrifice prisoners to get their blood and gain more health. Multiples runs will be necessary to finish the
dungeon.

I used to work alone on software. I try my best design good architecture and writing elegant code. Therefore, this was a
very good exercise for me working together quick and dirty.

Team was:

- [Pierre-Antoine Cinquin](https://twitter.com/pacinquin): art.
- Anna Loeff: art.
- [Thibault Lainé](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibault-laine-b811542a/): design, implementation, level design.
- [Joan Sol Roo](https://joansolroo.com): design, art and implementation.
- Erwan Normand: design, implementation and added musics and sounds (bought with the Humble "8 bit pixel game dev" Bundle).
